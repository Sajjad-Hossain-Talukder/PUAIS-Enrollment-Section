<b>PUAIS</b>( Premier University Academic Information System) which is a computer-based system designed to manage and process academic information such as student records, course schedules, faculty information, and administrative data. 


### Project Description: 

During Enrollment, sometimes it happens that, <b>student has exceeded the limit of credit</b>. And sometimes a student <b>can't enroll as the section has already the maximum number of students enrolled</b>. Then manual entry is given:



<ul>
    <li>There should be an option for the teacher to give the manual entry.</li>
    <li>Student can do the enrollment process as usual</li>
    <li>During enrollment, while a student selects a subject, if there is any limit, then message will be shown immediately</li>
    <li>This project assumes that the routine is not yet completed</li>
    <li>The aim of this project is to find those subjects having no overlapping students</li>
    <li><ul>After students request for the subjects, they want to enroll, there will be an option to find out those subjects as following rules:
        <li> First show those subjects which have no overlapping student</li>
        <li>Then display subjects in ascending order (first show subjects which have minimum overlapping etc. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
